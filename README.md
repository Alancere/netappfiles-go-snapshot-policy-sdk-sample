# Azure NetAppFiles Snapshot Policy SDK Sample for Go

This project demonstrates how to create a Snapshot Policy for Microsoft.NetApp resource provider using Go SDK. This process can be used with other supported protocol types as well.

In this sample application we perform the following operations:

* Creation
  * ANF Account
    * Snapshot Policy
    * Capacity pool
      * NFS v3 Volume with Snapshot Policy assigned
* Updates
  * Snapshot Policy
* Clean up created resources (not enabled by default)

If you don't already have a Microsoft Azure subscription, you can get a FREE trial account [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330212).

## Prerequisites

1. Go installed \(if not installed yet, follow the [official instructions](https://golang.org/dl/)\)
1. Azure Subscription
1. Subscription needs to be enabled for Azure NetApp Files. For more information, please refer to [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-register#waitlist) document.
1. (Valid only while Snapshot Policy is in preview state) Register the Snapshot Policy Feature. For more information, please refer to [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-manage-snapshots#register-the-feature) document.
1. Resource Group created
1. Virtual Network with a delegated subnet to Microsoft.Netapp/volumes resource. For more information, please refer to [Guidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-network-topologies)
1. Adjust variable contents within `var()` block at `example.go` file to match your environment
1. For this sample Go console application work, we need to authenticate and the chosen method for this sample is using service principals:
    * Within an [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) session, make sure you're logged on at the subscription where you want to be associated with the service principal by default

      ```bash
      az account show
      ```

      If this is not the correct subscription, use

      ```bash
      az account set -s <subscription name or id>  
      ```

    * Create a service principal using Azure CLI

      ```bash
      az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth
      ```

      >Note: this command will automatically assign RBAC contributor role to the service principal at subscription level, you can narrow down the scope to the specific resource group where your tests will create the resources.

    * Copy the output content and paste it in a file called azureauth.json and secure it with file system permissions (make sure it is not inside of any repo)
    * Set an environment variable pointing to the file path you just created, here is an example with Powershell and bash:

      Powershell

      ```powershell
      [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION", "C:\sdksample\azureauth.json", "User")
      ```

      Bash

      ```bash
      export AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION=/sdksamples/azureauth.json
      ```

    >Note: for other Azure Active Directory authentication methods for Go, please refer to [Authentication methods in the Azure SDK for Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/go/azure-sdk-go-authorization).

## What is example.go doing

This sample project is focused on demonstrating how to create and update **Snapshot Policies** in Azure NetApp Files for an NFSv3 enabled volume (note that this process is the same for NFSv4.1/CIFS volumes), similar to other examples, the authentication method is based on a service principal, this project will create an ANF Account, a capacity pool, then a Snapshot Policy and finally a single volume using Standard service level tier and assign it to the Snapshot Policy previously created.

In addition, we use some non-sensitive information from the *file-based authentication* file that in the initial stages we get the subscription ID and this is used for the test we perform to check if the provided subnet exists before starting creating any ANF resources, failing execution if it is missing.

Authentication is made on each operation where we obtain an authorizer to pass to each client we instantiate (in Azure Go SDK for NetAppFiles each resource has its own client). For more information about the authentication process used, refer to [Use file-based authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/go/azure-sdk-go-authorization#use-file-based-authentication) section of [Authentication methods in the Azure SDK for Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/go/azure-sdk-go-authorization) document.

Lastly, the clean up process takes place (not enabled by default, please change variable `shouldCleanUp` to `true` at `example.go` file `var()` section if you want clean up), deleting all resources in the reverse order following the hierarchy otherwise we can't remove resources that have nested resources. Summarizing the clean up process we have the following deletion order: Volume -> Capacity Pool -> Snapshot Policy -> Account. If there is an error during the application execution, clean up may not take place and you will need to manually perform this task. You will notice that the clean up process uses a function called `WaitForNoANFResource` while other parts of the code uses `WaitForANFResource`, at this moment this is required so we can workaround a current ARM behavior of reporting that the object was deleted when in fact its deletion is still in progress, similarly, stating that volume is fully created while this is still finishing up. Also, we will see some functions called `GetANF<resource type>`, these were created in this sample to be able to get the name of the resource without its hierarchy represented in the `<resource type>.name` property, which cannot be used directly in other methods of Azure NetApp Files client like `get`.

>Note: Please refer to [Resource limits for Azure NetApp Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-resource-limits) to understand ANF's most current limits.

## How to run

1. Go to your GOPATH folder and create the following path
    ```powershell
    # PowerShell example
    cd $env:GOPATH/src
    mkdir ./github.com/Azure-Samples
    ```

    ```bash
    # Bash example
    cd $GOPATH/src
    mkdir -p ./github.com/Azure-Samples
    ```
2. Clone it locally
    ```bash
    cd github.com/Azure-Samples
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/netappfiles-go-snapshot-policy-sdk-sample.git
    ```
3. Change folder to **netappfiles-go-snapshot-policy-sdk-sample/netappfiles-go-snapshot-policy-sdk-sample**
    ```bash
    cd netappfiles-go-snapshot-policy-sdk-sample/netappfiles-go-snapshot-policy-sdk-sample
    ```
4. Make sure you have the `azureauth.json` and its environment variable with the path to it defined (as previously described at [prerequisites](#Prerequisites))
6. Edit file **example.go** `var()` block and change the variables contents as appropriate (names are self-explanatory).
7. Run the sample
    ```bash
    go run .
    ```
